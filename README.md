Part 1 shows the process of loading and preloading the data. The details are explained in this medium article https://medium.com/@oyewusiwuraola/opinion-mining-using-the-uci-drug-review-data-set-part-1-data-loading-and-pre-processing-using-49d3fb6025a8.

The Data sets are also listed both in the unprocessed form and the processed form after preprocessing. 

Part 2 shows using the processed data from Part 1 to train a Machine Learning Classifier Algorithm(Scikit Implementation) to build Model to predict sentiment.
